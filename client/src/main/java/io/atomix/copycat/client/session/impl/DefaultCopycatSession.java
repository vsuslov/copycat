/**
 * Handles submitting state machine {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} to the Copycat cluster.
 * <p>
 * The client session is responsible for maintaining a client's connection to a Copycat cluster and coordinating
 * the submission of {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} to various nodes in the cluster. Client
 * sessions are single-use objects that represent the context within which a cluster can guarantee linearizable
 * semantics for state machine operations. When a session is {@link #register() opened}, the session will register
 * itself with the cluster by attempting to contact each of the known servers. Once the session has been successfully
 * registered, kee-alive requests will be periodically sent to keep the session alive.
 * <p>
 * Sessions are responsible for sequencing concurrent operations to ensure they're applied to the system state
 * in the order in which they were submitted by the client. To do so, the session coordinates with its server-side
 * counterpart using unique per-operation sequence numbers.
 * <p>
 * In the event that the client session expires, clients are responsible for opening a new session by creating and
 * opening a new session object.
